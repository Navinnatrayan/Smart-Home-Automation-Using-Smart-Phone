*INTRODUCTION

      Smart home systems currently play an important role in ensuring a high quality of life. A smart home system consists of subsystems based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology that are suitable for various purposes, such as surveillance, intruder control and fire detection. Consider a scenario in which the user can view the status of his or her home environment and control his or her home appliances, for example, turn on the television and set it to his or her favorite channel, turn on the air conditioner, or switch the lights on or off, from anywhere in the house.

     Home automation is also named as domestics or Smart home .It involves the control and automation of lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning and security, as well as home appliances. Wi-Fi is often used for remote monitoring and control. Home devices, when remotely monitored and controlled via Internet is a part of Internet of things. Modern systems generally consists of switches and sensors connected to a central hub called a gateway from which the system is controlled with a user interface that is interacted either with a mobile phone software tablet, computers or a web interface,often but not always via internet cloud services. World's demand for electricity had grown 85% between 2010 and 2017.

    Home, it is the place where one fancies or desires to be after a long tiring day. People come home exhausted after a long hard working day. Some are way too tired that they find it hard to move once they land on their couch, sofa or bed. So any small device technology that would help them switch theirs lights on or off, or play their favourite music etc. on a go with their voice with the aid of their smart phones would make their home more comfortable.

    Home automation or domestics is building automation for a home, called a smart home or smart house. A home automation system will control lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems. [2] When connected with the Internet, home devices are an important constituent of the Internet of Things.

    A home automation system typically connects controlled devices to a central hub or "gateway". The user interface for control of the system uses either wall-mounted terminals, tablet or desktop computers, a mobile phone application, or a Web interface, that may also be accessible off-site through the Internet.

*IMPLEMENTATIONS

     In a review of home automation devices. Consumer Reports found two main concerns for consumers: A Wi-Fi network connected to the internet can be vulnerable to hacking

     Technology is still in its infancy, and consumers could invest in a system that becomes abandon ware. In 2014, Google bought the company selling the Revolv Hub home automation system, integrated it with Nest and in 2016 shut down the servers Revolv Hub depended on, rendering the hardware useless.
     Microsoft Research found in 2011, that home automation could involve high cost of ownership, inflexibility of interconnected devices, and poor manageability. 
     Historically systems have been sold as complete systems where the consumer relies on one vendor for the entire system including the handware, the communications protocol, the central hub, and the user interface. However, there are now open hardware and open source witware systems which can be med instead of or with proprietary hardware.

     Moreover, it would be better if everything such as warming bath water and adjusting the room temperature was already done before they reach their home just by prisg a voice command. So, when people would arrive home, they would find the room temperature, the bath water adjud to their suitable preferences, and they could relax right away and feel ooier and rather, feel more homely

     Humans like hokeepers were a way for millionaires to keep up their homes in the past Even now when technology is handy enough only the well to do people of the society are blessed with the new smart home devices, as these devices costs are a hit high. However, not everyone is wealthy enough to be able to afford a human assistant, of some smart home kit. Hence, the nood for finding an inexpensive and smart assistant for normal families keeps growing

     Users often need to control and monitor the environmental variables of their homes, even when they are not at home. In this project, we present a multifunctional, low-cost, and flexible system for smart home control monitoring. This system employs an ambedded based on an Arduino Nano microcontroller with bluetooth connectivity that allows remote device control. The proposed system can be controlled via the bluetooth connection through an Android-based mobile app.
